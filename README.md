# Eloquent JavaScript

A couple of years ago, I found what I consider to be the best book on the market for _anyone_ interested in learning JavaScript. It approaches the language with tact, such that those who have never thought of programming beforehand can understand it, and those that have been working with other languages for years can enjoy it. I can't recommend it enough.

Support Marijn, the author, by visiting the site that he hosts the entire book (with examples) on, or buying a copy.

## This Repo

I'm using this repository as a means of centralizing a remote for saving my progress of exercises I perform at the end of each chapter.

The notes found in [JOURNAL.md](./JOURNAL.md) track things I'm noticing while progressing through the book itself, written after finishing a chapter and publishing exercise solutions.
